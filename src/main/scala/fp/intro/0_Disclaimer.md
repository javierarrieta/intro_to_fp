# Disclaimers

* This intro has little value for your daily coding
* This is a very quick intro that only hints at how to
  code using Functional Programming techniques
* Hopefully this will pique your interest so you can dive
  deeper on your own. Feel free to ask the instructor for
  help or materials to learn on your own.
* There is a full FP training in the works, but cannot commit on
  a date when it will be scheduled.
* Please ask questions during the course, I am going fast and
  expecting you to ask questions when things are not clear or
  want to explore what consequences the explained techniques
  have on maintenance, performance, etc.
