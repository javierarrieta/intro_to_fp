# Disclaimers/Comments

* This intro has little value for your daily coding
* This is a very quick intro that only hints at how to
  code using Functional Programming techniques
* This is not a Scala course, no Scala experience needed,
  syntax is very similar to other languages so hopefully
  easy to follow
* Hopefully this will pique your interest so you can dive
  deeper on your own. Feel free to ask the instructor for
  help or materials to learn on your own.
* There is a full FP training in the works, but cannot
  commit on a date when it will be scheduled.
* Please ask questions during the course, I am going fast and
  expecting you to ask questions when things are not clear
  or want to explore what consequences the explained
  techniques have on maintenance, performance, etc.
* You can play in scastie, I configured a playground
  in https://scastie.scala-lang.org/javierarrieta/HTL71MTQTCWBOMapnOKj6Q/1
